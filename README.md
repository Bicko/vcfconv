# vcfconv
Take a .vcf contacts list and convert it to something compatible with the 'Conatcts' in Tobii Communicator.

(Initially, while work is in progress, the program is coded to read the supplied .vcf file (00001.vcf) directly. Later, we'll use sys.argv to take it from the command line.
Contacts-example.ini is an example of what the output ultimately aims to be compatible with.)
